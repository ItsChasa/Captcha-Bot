# Captcha Verification
Pretty good project that I made, ngl lmao.

### Features
* Auto-kick
* 3 Attempts
* No captcha is the same. (62^6 = 56,800,235,584 different captchas)
* If bot is offline, they don't need the role to verify.
* No Multi-Guild Support (yetâ„¢)

No point hiding all of my code behind an encrypted wall, so here it is.
Use it how you want to, even learn a couple things or two. I will go in detail (or sometimes briefly) about how the code works and functions. So if you're a coding nerd like me, you will probably enjoy this. :)

If you have anything you'd like to add or just want to talk to people who are similar minded, join my [Discord Server](https://chasa.wtf).
